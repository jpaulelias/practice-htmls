<p><em>Unemployment begins</em> (San Diego, 2012)</p>

<h3><em>Education:</em></h3>
  <li><strong>San Diego State University</strong></li>
    <em>M.A. Political Science</em> (2014)
    <p>What do you do when you graduate in the middle of a recession? You go
    to grad school! Here you become familiar with all nineteen of the coffeeshops
  in your city as you search for constant mental stimulation to get you past the
drudgery of reading dense texts. If you think all this political knowledge will
one day help you convince your conservative uncles that climate change is real and
refugees are people, too, you are sorely mistaken. Nonetheless, you now know how
to distinguish a hipster discussing politics from someone who actually knows what
they're talking about. Hooray for grad school.</p>

  <li><strong>San Diego State University:</strong></li>
    <em>B.A. Political Science and Spanish, minor in English</em> (2011)
    <p>During my time as an undergrad, I studied abroad in Argentina to improve
      my Spanish. I got a minor in English because I wanted credit for reading books.
      Mission accomplished. My three favorite authors at the moment are: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>W.G. Sebald</li>
    <li>Anne Patchett</li>
    <li>Junot Diaz</li>
  </ul>

<h3><em>Favorite Websites:</em></h3>
  <ol>
    <li><a href="https://jacobinmag.com">Jaocbin</li></a>
    <p>The <em>best</em> site for your political analysis. Updated weekly.</p>
    <li><a href="https://theguardian.com">The Guardian</li></a>
      <p>The best site for up-to-date news. Book, film reviews and political
         analyses are pretty good, too.</p>
    <li><a href="https://duolingo.com">Duolingo</li></a>
    <p>If you want to learn a language, there's no better place to start (but
      not finish) your language journey.</p>
  </ol>

<h3><em>Current Interests:</em></h3>
<p>Funemployment can be daunting. Luckily, I've found ways to fill my days</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Language learning</strong></li>

<p>Over the last few months, I've gotten into language learning and discovered
  a community of polyglots whose advice I found really inspiring. All of them
  claim no special gift for language learning beyond being really motivated.
  Moreover, there's some consensus that if one were to spend an hour a day, every
  day for a year studying French, for example, in an effective way, by the year's
  end you'd be at about intermediate fluency.</p>
<p>I've always wanted to be multilingual, so I started my own five-year plan.
    This year, I'll try to learn Turkish and Italian simultaneously since I have a
    a lot of free time. Next year, I'll give a year to Dutch, then
    French, then German all while maintaining as best I can the preceding languages.
    Three months into this five-year plan and it's going well!</p>

  <li><strong>Basketball</strong></li>
  <p>About every other day I go up to the park to shoot some hoops. I'm getting
    pretty good with my left-hand even, Hopefully this is also the year the
    Sacramento Kings stop being a national laughingstock. One can dream.
    <em>Insallah</em> as the Turks say.</p>

  <li><strong>Travel</strong></li>
  <p>In my short life I've been lucky enough to travel a lot. Here's a list of
    all the countries I've been to, divided by continent:</p>

  <ul><strong><em>North America<strong></em></ul>
    <li>U.S.A</li>
    <li>Mexico</li>
    <li>Canada</li>

  <ul><strong><em>South America</strong></em></ul>
    <li>Argentina</li>
    <li>Bolivia</li>
    <li>Uruguay</li>
    <li>Chile</li>
    <li>Colombia</li>
    <li>Brazil</li>

  <ul><strong><em>Europe</strong></em></ul>
  <img src="img/europe.jpeg" alt "A map of Europe.">
    <li>Italy</li>
    <li>France</li>
    <li>The Netherlands</li>
    <li>Sweden</li>
    <li>Germany</li>
    <li>England</li>
    <li>Poland</li>

    <li>Spain</li>

  <li>Egypt</li>
  <li>Nigera</li>
  <li>Ghana</li>
<img src="img/egypt.jpeg" alt "An old man in Cairo.">
</ul>

<p>Only Australia and Antarctica to go! But despite how long these lists may look
  I feel like I've haven't really even scratched the surface of any of these countries!
  This past year I lived in Turkey as a Fulbright scholar, and there's tons more
  I could learn about my city of 90,000, let alone the whole country.</p>

<p>This year I'm hoping to visit my brother who lives in Odawara, Japan.
  Funds permitting.</p>

<p>Well, that about sums up the summary. Thanks for stopping by. To close, I'd
  like to end with my favorite Emily Dickenson quote:</p>
  <p><strong><em>"If your nerve deny you, rise above your nerve."</p></strong></em>

  <p>Adieu!</p>
